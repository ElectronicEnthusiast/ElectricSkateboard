# ignore Cordova/PhoneGap CLI directories
# in essence, use git to manage everything but
# *.xdk file, www directory, and other '!/' files listed below

# In some projects you might be tempted to keep the plugins directory under git,
# but you are better off not doing that and making sure your plugins are well
# specified for retrieval into a fresh copy of your project. If one of your plugins
# is a customized plugin, you should maintain that custom plugin in a separate repo
# and then add it as a "local" plugin.
